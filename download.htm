                <h4>To install VASL:</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>Download the VASL module by clicking on the button above. Open the VASL ZIP file and save the enclosed module (.vmod) file to a known location.</li>
                  <li>Download Vassal (<a href="http://www.Vassalengine.org/" target="_blank">http://www.Vassalengine.org/</a>) and install it on your machine.</li>
                  <li>Start Vassal. Select the File->Open module... menu option in Vassal and navigate to and select the saved VASL module file.</li>
                  <li>You'll see a dialog box showing that Vassal is tiling the VASL images. This makes the images more efficient while using VASL.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>VASL 6.5.* requires Vassal 3.2.17. If you save a game, or log in VASL 6.5.*, you will NOT be able to open it afterwards with earlier versions of VASL.</p>
                <p>VASL 6.6.3 works with Vassal 3.5.8.</p>
                <p>Vassal 3.2.17 or later requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 or later.</p>
                <p>Vassal 3.4.6 and above bundle Java and so no separate Java installation is required.</p>

          <h2 class="pull-right">Updated December 3, 2021</h2>
          <h3>New in version 6.6.3.1:</h3>

          <li>This is an urgent update to incorporate a VASSAL bug fix.</li>
          <br>
          <p>We have been asked by VASSAL to issue this update to address a problem when running VASL with VASSAL3.6.0</p>
          <p>If you are NOT using VASSAL3.6.0 you may ignore this update</p>
          <br>
          <p>This update to 6.6.3 also incorporates VASL bug fixes contained in VASL6.6.4-beta1 and VASL6.6.4-beta2</p>
          <br>
          <li>Compatibility issues: 6.6.3.1 is generally compatible with games saved in 6.6.2. Some bug fixes which required changes to certain counters will not work for counters created in 6.6.2 but they should maintain their previous functionality</li>
          <br>

          <h3>New in version 6.6.3:</h3>
          <li>This version is about terrain issues:</li>
          <br>
          <p>Fixed Orchard-to-Cactus Patch transformation on bd25</p>
          <p>Fixed LOS to Crest location in a Depression hex</p>
          <p>LOS now works with RB/RO gutted factory overlays</p>
          <p>LOS bug with cropped Deluxe boards is fixed</p>
          <p>LOS bug with deluxe-sized hexes fixed</p>
          <p>bd41 and bd47 Marsh transforms and Orchard-to-Shellhole transform fixed</p>
          <p>LOS to On-Map bridges and to Bridge and Crest Counters fixed</p>
          <p>LOS now works on desert boards 26-31, plus when using hillock, wadi, dier and sand dune (low only) overlays</p>
          <p>Expanded environmental shaders for Dust, Fog, Sun Blindness, Heat Haze. Thanks to Morris Legge for this work!</p>
          <p>Some under the hood changes will clean up minor bugs and irritants</p>
          <br>
          <li>Plus, we did some other stuff:</li>
          <br>
          <p>Added a preference to enable the Player Window (menus, toolbars, chat, dice) to be always on top when in uncombined window mode. Player Window is resizeable</p>
          <p>You can now add an offboard observer location (not counter) to a board edge hex at specified height and draw LOS to/from it as if to an upper-level building. Plus, all hexes now allow the los string to go up 10 levels and down 3 levels of “virtual locations”. These features only work on boards with vasl los added.</p>
          <p>? was preventing some vehicles from moving via CTRL-numpad. Fixed</p>
          <p>Broken units moved to the Casualty Bin now revert to GO side in the Bin; Striped squad CVP fixed</p>
          <p>Added a CA pointer for all veh/guns. Shift-Alt-Q to toggle on/off on individual vehicle/gun. Shift-Alt-W to toggle on/off for all vehicle/guns in the game (must have at least one selected to toggle). Thanks to Neal Ulen for the hard work on this one</p>
          <p>The Counter Detail window (hover over stack) now shows base level of hex along with hexname</p>
          <p>Updated the Help files and converted them to PDFs. Plus added a more complete listing of Hotkeys. Many thanks to Jeff Wright for his great work on this.</p>
          <p>Moved VASL to Vassal 3.5.8. You will need Vassal 3.5.8 to run this VASL version. Any other version is at your own risk:
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Compatibility issues: 6.6.3 is generally compatible with games saved in 6.6.2. Some bug fixes which required changes to certain counters will not work for counters created in 6.6.2 but they should maintain their previous functionality</li>
              <li>Finally, please note that virtually every board was updated since 6.6.2 was released. This was the start of a big effort to eliminate redundant components in the board files which will make solving board issues much easier and will simplify adding new terrain transformations. It will slow down bug fixing for the next year or so but will pay big benefits.</li>

          <h3>New in version 6.6.2:</h3>
          <li>This version is about bug fixes:</li>
          <br>
          <p>Crashes during Board Selection and Setup. We fixed a couple of bugs that caused issues when using the BoardPicker wizard at startup. </p>
          <p>AFV’s marked with a Bad Things label now show up in the Broken/Malf Finder.</p>
          <p>Fixed issues causing the “Outdated Custom Code” messages.</p>
          <p>Fixed North Korean concealment and Italian 347 BH bugs.</p>
          <p>Fixed bug with Marsh to Level 0 terrain transformation.</p>
          <p>Units moved with Numpad now report move and are marked moved. </p>
          <p>LOS Freezing- to prevent LOS freezing when both players check LOS at the same time, the los buttons on remote devices are disabled once a player clicks his los button. Ending the los check enables the other player’s buttons again.</p>
          <p>Cropping to a Full Hex was still kicking out the los engine in some situations. Fixed that dead.</p>
          <p>Blind hex Gully bugs – fixed a minor bug when determining blind hexes in los and when tracing los into a Gully.</p>
          <p>Board-specific Overlays (those listed in the TerrainSSR window) now only block los when touched by los thread. </p>
          <p>Board-specific Overlays (those listed in the TerrainSSR window) now only block los when touched by los thread.</p>
          <p>Chat window now reports if VASL los enabled or disabled at game startup.</p>
          <br>
          <li>Plus, we did some other stuff:</li>
          <br>
          <p>Moved VASL to Vassal 3.5.5. You will need Vassal 3.5.5 to run this VASL version. Any other version is at your own risk.</p>
          <p>Created a separate VASL tab in Preferences. All those listed there are specific to VASL – use it to set the red circle “look here” preference. Those remaining under the General tab are Vassal Preferences. </p>
          <p>Created a separate VASL tab in Preferences. All those listed there are specific to VASL – use it to set the red circle “look here” preference. Those remaining under the General tab are Vassal Preferences. </p>
          <p>Added functionality to the Casualties Bin: you can now send an AFV to the Casualty Bin and create a wreck on the map with one click. Same for CRing Squad to a HS and sending a HS to the Bin (there is also an option to ELR the squad first). But you will still have to break the remaining HS (if needed) with another click. Prisoner CVP values can now be changed. BH or ELR leaders now changes their CVP.</p>
          <p>Added CX menu option to ? counters. (This was flagged as an issue in October 2015; we may be slow but we don’t go fast).</p>
          <p>Added a Dust Shader button. Works like the night shader only with a number of gradients.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>We added custom phase track wheels that enable you to use individual nationality icons in the phase wheel and turn track tools. Plus the phase tracker now runs for 40 turns! Credit Gordon Molek and Walter Parker for their assistance with the custom turn markers and phase wheel. Gordon did all the turn and reinforcement marker graphics. Walter figured out the way to get the phase tracker to go up to turn 40.</p>
          <p>Vassal 3.5.5 fixes a bug that was eliminating the first character typed in the chat window.</p>
          <br>
          <li>Compatibility issues: 6.6.2 is compatible with games saved in 6.6.1. Unit counters created in 6.6.1 will not have the new Casualties Bin options but can still be sent to the Bin and have their CVP added. </li>
          <br>
          <li>To use VASL 6.6.2 you must first download and install Vassal 3.5.5.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Important:</li>
          <li>Games created in VASL 6.5.0 or 6.5.1 will work in VASL 6.6.2 but not all new functionality will work with counters created in 6.5.X. Games created in earlier versions of VASL won't work in VASL 6.6.2.</li>
          <li>It is possible to have both Vassal 3.2.17 running VASL 6.5.1 AND Vassal 3.5.5 running VASL 6.6.2 on your device at the same time. It is not an either/or choice.</li>

          <h2 class="pull-right">Updated October 15, 2020</h2>
          <h3>New in version 6.6.1:</h3>
          <li>VASL 6.6.1 contains 5 changes from 6.6.0</li>
          <ul>
            <li> 1. The moving stack causes counters to disappear bug is fixed</li>
            <li> 2. The fuzzy toolbar images are fixed</li>
            <li> 3. A problem with the Dice toolbar appearance is fixed</li>
            <li> 4. Several “out of date custom code” warnings have been resolved</li>
            <li> 5. There is a new “Bad Things” submenu for vehicles</li>
            <li> It allows you to put a label on the vehicle counter for malfs, disabled and Immob/Bog/Mired, rather than use a counter. Repeatedly clicking on the menu item will cycle through the Malf, Disabled, Good Order states. This is an alternative to using the counters but does not replace them; they are still available. If you don’t like labels, don’t click on the submenu! All this work courtesy of Stephen Stewart.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <li>To use VASL 6.6.1 you must first download and install Vassal 3.4.6.</li>
          <li>There is always the possibility that using Vassal 3.4.6 will introduce new issues and it is important to flag any that you find.</li>
          <li>A major-league shout out to Joel Uckelman and the Vassal team who worked very hard to configure VASL to work with the new Vassal. We appreciate their efforts.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Important:</li>
          <li>VASL 6.6.1 works with Vassal 3.4.6. At this point, due in part to the rapid changes been made to Vassal, there is no assurance that VASL 6.6.1 will work on other Vassal versions.</li>
          <li>Games created in VASL 6.5.0 or 6.5.1 will work in VASL 6.6.1. Games created in earlier versions of VASL won't work in VASL 6.6.1.</li>

          <h3>New in version 6.5.0:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>New Features
              <ul>
                <li>1. Casualties Bin</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>This feature automates tracking of CVP during a scenario. All CVP-eligible units (infantry, vehicles, guns, planes, and LC) now start with their full CVP value as the default. They can be moved to a casualties bin which will track and report on total CVP for Allied/Axis sides. CVP for individual units can be adjusted as required by SSRs, CGs or other situations.</li>
                  <li>To Move A Unit to the Casualties Bin:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Right click on the unit, select Casualties Bin and then either Allied or Axis from the submenu. This allows for maximum flexibility (think Italians or prisoners) as to which side the CVP should be allocated.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>To Change the CVP of a unit:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Right click on the unit, select Reset CVP and then enter the new CVP value. This has to be done for each unit. Changing the CVP of one Russian 447 in a scenario won’t change it for all Russian 447 in the game.</li>
                    <li>If you are using DVP, you will need to do this for each vehicle in the Casualties Bin.</li>
                    <li>For vehicles, you can reset the base CVP value as above or you can reduce the CVP by clicking on CVP Modifiers and then selecting one of the four submenu items which will change the CVP by (1) -1 for malf/disabled MA; (2) – 2 if the crew survives; (3) -3 if the MA is malf/disabled and the crew survives; or (4) return CVP to the default value.</li>
                    <li>While crews are built into the vehicle CVP, Armor Leaders are not. To add an AL to the Casualties Bin, the AL counter must be put on board and then sent to the Casualties Bin.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>To View CVP Counts:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>For a quick count, click on the CVP button on the tool bar and a current total will show up in the chat window for Allied CVP and Axis CVP.</li>
                    <li>For a detailed view, click on the Casualties Bin button on the tool bar and the Casualties Bin will display with a stack of those units sent to the Bin in each of the Allied and Axis areas. Those units cannot, in this version, be automatically sorted, but they can be re-stacked and sorted manually and their CVP values can be changed as above while in the Casualties Bin. Clicking on the Allied CVP or Axis CVP buttons at the top of the Casualties Bin window will update the CVP total for that side (only). You can close the window normally or leave it open.</li>
                    <li>All Casualties Bin actions will be saved by Save Game.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>To Handle Wrecks and Casualty Reduction:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>For Wrecks, before turning the vehicle into a wreck, clone it, send one version to the Casualties Bin and then change the other to a wreck.</li>
                    <li>For Casualty Reduction, turn the squad into a hs, clone the hs, send one version to the Casualties Bin and leave the other on the main map and apply any further actions (such as breaking) to it.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Version Compatibility:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>For both players to see and use the Casualties Bin, they will both need 6.5.</li>
                    <li>Games saved with previous versions of the game can be opened with 6.5 and will work normally. In terms of the Casualties Bin, existing unit counters will not contain the Casualties Bin functionality. However, new unit counters dragged from the Counters Window will. Simply replace the existing counters with one from the Counters Window whenever a unit needs to go the Casualties Bin.</li>
                    <li>Some counters that should not have the Casualties Bin menu items may have them. This is due to the way counters are created in VASL. If you find such counters, please report them.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Extensions:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Unit counters added by extensions will not have the Casualties Bin functionality even though they will have the popup menu items.</li>
                    <li>Sending such a counter to the Casualties Bin will produce an error message in the chat window and will not add CVP points to the Allied or Axis totals. However, the game will not crash, and you will be able to continue to play normally.</li>
                    <li>With the agreement of Third Parties Producers, it would be possible to work with those who have produced Extensions with unit counters to see if the Casualties Bin functionality could be applied to those counters. This work is underway on the BFP Extension.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Vehicle CVP special case:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>A reminder that when determining the CVP of a vehicle, the highest possible AF is used. In the case of vehicles with Front AF inside a square box, this can raise their CVP.</li>
                    <li>For example, a vehicle with a squared 8 AF will be treated as having 11 AF for CVP calculation purposes, resulting in 3 CVP for armor rather than 2 CVP.</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
                <li>2. Counter Finder</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>This feature lets players search for hard to find counters such as motorcycle counters or Out of Gas or NVR counters.</li>
                  <li>To use, click on the "Ctr Search" button located between the INFO and Night buttons on the toolbar. You will have two ways to locate a counter: search and scroll.</li>
                  <li>To Search:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Enter a counter name in the text box with the text "Enter Counter Name". Then click the "Search" button. The location of the counter will show up in the other text box.</li>
                    <li>If no match is found the text box will report this. This will happen. For example, looking for bicycle counters - enter "Bicycle". You will get a result. Enter "Bicycles" will get you no joy. You can just keep entering different counter names.</li>
                    <li>Clicking on Clear will reset the text boxes to their original state but is not required between individual searches. The search function is case insensitive so both “Wind” and “wind” will find the Wind counter.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>To Scroll:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>A scrollable list is displayed at the bottom of the window. Scroll down the list until you find the counter you want in the left-hand column. The right-hand column will tell you where it is in the counter palette.</li>
                    <li>In both cases, what you get is the location of the counter in the counter palette (which opens when you click on the German 467 icon on the tool bar). You will not be taken to that location; you have to get there yourself. Just navigate through the tabs and panels as you normally would.</li>
                    <li>This is meant to handle those hard to find counters. It won't work for units: infantry, vehicles, guns, LC and planes. Basically, anything that is found under the Axis O/B or Allied O/B tabs is excluded (with some exceptions like Bicycles, Dozers). It is also not going to find counters in extensions.</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
              </ul>
            <li>Bug Fixes</li>
            <ul>
              <li>1. LOS Fix for rubbled upper levels and split levels</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Rubble counters (both stone and wood) can now be incremented by level via their popup menu just as building level counters can. The LOS tool will recognize the applicable level of the rubble counter. Drag the Wooden Rubble counter off the Toolbar and change type and level as required.</li>
                <li>The total height of Split-level buildings, including underlying terrain, is now correctly calculated and so the LOS tool works.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>2. LOS Bug fix to handle BFPDWxb and deluxe boards when flipped and cropped</li>
              <ul>
                <li>A couple of board configurations needed a fix to fully enable flipping and cropping.</li>
                <li>Plus, a few other minor bugs to fix cropping and flipping errors.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>3. Concealment Chart error fixed</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Counter Changes</li>
            <ul>
              <li>1. Korea: Forgotten War counters are now part of the main VASL module</li>
              <ul>
                <li>All the counters from the KFW extension have now been added to the core VASL module, meaning that the KFW extension is no longer required for VASL 6.5 forwards. All hail Al Cannamore for a huge effort on the KFW counters!!</li>
              </ul>
              <li>2. EC/Weather counters have been updated </li>
              <ul>
                <li>The entire set of EC/Weather counters have been redone as per a long-standing thread on GS. Many of them can be flipped or incremented to reflect different conditions. They are still found in the same place in the Counter Palette (Other/Map/EC).</li>
              </ul>
              <li>3. Several counter bugs were fixed</li>
              <ul>
                <li>The images for the German 20L(6) AA gun and versions of the Finnish T-26 vehicle were corrected. A problem with LC wrecks was fixed.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Board Updates</li>
            <ul>
              <li>While not strictly part of VASL 6.5, a reminder of some of the board updates that have taken place over the last year. Auto syncing should be taking care of this for you; if you have downloaded a board from VASL.info recently, you are probably doing something wrong!</li>
              <li>1. LOS has now been applied to all Deluxe boards</li>
              <li>2. Festung Budapest boards have been updated to version 6.0+</li>
              <li>3. Bugs in various individual boards have been fixed: BFP, bd40, bd50, bd70, bdRileys</li>
              <li>4. The addition of Light Woods transformation to all boards has been completed and various bugs fixed</li>
              <li>Of course, a whole group of new boards were VASLized over the past year. A lot of hard work by a bunch of folks.</li>

          <h2 class="pull-right">Updated Sept., 2018</h2>
          <h3>New in version 6.4.3:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>New board selection process:
              <ul>
                <li>This version of VASL introduces a new twist to the board selection process: when selecting boards for a new scenario, ALL boards will show up on the dropdown list and when selected the most recent version will be automatically download to the player’s local drive. </li>
                <li>This will eliminate the need for players themselves to download boards, even new boards as they are issued. You will always have access to the latest version of any VASL-ized board.</li>
                <li>Prior to this, the automatic board syncing process only worked if you already had a version of the board on your local drive. </li>
                <li>The new process also works if you are joining an online game which is using a board not already on your machine or where your board version is out of date. </li>
                <li>As with automatic board syncing, this new process requires an internet connection. If you are playing without a connection you will have access to those boards already on your local drive.</li>
                <li>For those who chose not to update to this VASL version (sadface), you will be able to get new boards AND new board versions manually from VASL.info. The automatic board syncing in previous versions will no longer work. Why, you ask? Good question. Because the process of making it work requires a cumbersome, error-prone, manual back-end process that we wish to eliminate so that we can spend our time making VASL better. Seriously; we need to make this change. </li>
                <li>Minor detail: if you have boards on your local drive that are not in the VASL.info repository, they will show up in your dropdown list. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>LOS Enhancements and bug fixes:
              <ul>
                <li>Added LOS Checking for Light Woods</li>
                <li>LOS works with multiple instances of the same board. You can now use the LOS tool on a map that uses multiple instances of the same board; those boards can be cropped and flipped and have overlays added as well. </li>
                <li>Red Barricades BSO overlays work with LOS. We received a request to see if we could get Board Specific Overlays (those added by clicking on the Terrain SSR button and then selecting “bdXX special overlays” or “bdXX Terrain Transformations”), to work with the LOS Engine on the Red Barricades Map. Success! We then tried to apply a more generalized solution that would work for all los-enabled boards. Fail. So, the RB fixes are in but that’s all. </li>
                <li>Resolved LOS problem with slopes </li>
                <li>Resolved LOS Hindrance bug with Wreck Blazes</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>New overlay:
              <ul>
                <li>A re-sizeable blank hex grid overlay has been added to aid in offboard entry placement. But it up against the map edge and place entering units on it. Right-click the overlay to see full range of adjustment. Found in the Draggable Overlay window (not the Overlays extension) under the Hex Grid tab. Same for Deluxe version. Shout out to Al Cannamore for his work on this. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Counter fixes:
              <ul>
                <li>Remove SdKfz 10/4 & 10/5 under veh/ht menu. Correct counters are under SPA.</li>
                <li>Remove turret from GAZ-4M-AA.</li>
                <li>Wolverine s# fix.</li>
                <li>Relocate Steeple Counter to Info>Locate.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>6.4.1 contains a preference that allows players to choose whether counters underneath a stack show as white or as colored. To set the preference:

                <li>As we keep trying to wrestle LOS problems to the ground, we sometimes have to update the board files. A bunch of boards will update automatically if you have automatic board synchronization (requires VASL 6.3.0 and above). If you are using a version below this then don’t worry the board changes won’t affect anything anyway. But the new versions are on the website.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Enhancements:
              <ul>
                <li>Improved sniper finder; now functions like broken piece finder (highlights snipers on map).</li>
                <li>Draggable overlays; when setting up a game, rather than having to enter the overlay name and hexes in a dialogue box, you can drag them onto the map. Previous method still supported. To use this feature you must install a VASL extension. Download the extension from <a href="http://vasl.info/extensions.htm">http://vasl.info/extensions.htm</a>. For installation instructions for extensions, see the User Guide at VASL.info. Instructions for using the draggable overlays during game play are included in the extension and can be accessed via the Help menu in VASL.</li>
                <li>Counter linking. You can link two counters together and display a line showing the link. Great for Guns and acquisition counters or firer-target pairs. To link: select any two counters, CTRL-ALT-L. Linkline will show. Click elsewhere and Linkline will disappear. Re-click one of the counters and Linkline will reappear. To end link, select both counters, CTRL-ALT-U.</li>
                <li>LOS Checking for HASL maps; starting with the Red Barricades map, LOS checking is being extended to HASL maps.</li>
                <li>LOS Checking for rooftops, cellars added; LOS can now be traced from rooftops and cellars for all multi-hex buildings on boards 1-75, including 1a-9b.</li>
                <li>LOS Checking stays enabled regardless of cropping and/or flipping configurations.</li>
                <li>Counters under a “?” now show as white (reversion to previous style due to popular demand).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Fixes:
              <ul>
                <li>Improvements to LOS checking, especially with respect to depressions and cliff hexsides. Using UpArrow/DownArrow keys and CTRL-UpArrow/DownArrow to change level of target/firer in LOS check results now displays on opponent’s device as well. Plus, same keys can be used to switch LOS check from base hex to entrenchment if one is present in the hex. Entrenchment is “below” the base hex.</li>
                <li>Versioning problems with Desert boards have been fixed. An extensive cleanup of board files has been done, which should improve speed and performance.</li>
                <li>A problem with counters disappearing from extension windows has been resolved.</li>
                <li>Several bugs causing VASL or Vassal to crash were eliminated.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Known Issues:
              <ul>
                <li>The stream terrain under the elevated road bridges on Board 13 will show as one level higher than it should be, plus LOS that passes through these bridge hexes may show incorrect hindrances.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Compatibility Issues:
              <ul>
                <li>A number of these changes (i.e., counter linking and LOS improvements) require both players to be using 6.4.0 when playing online; otherwise the game will run but the enhancements will not function. Updated board versions are also required for many of the LOS improvements (and should automatically update when starting a game; if not, they can be downloaded from the boards page at VASL.info).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Kudos and Credits:
              <ul>
                <li>Doug Rimmer for pushing 6.4.0 out the door.</li>
                <li>David Sullivan for helping us find those Sniper Counters buried under stacks of stacks, for counter linking and for most of the bug fixes, with additional work by Zoltan Grose.</li>
                <li>Allan Cannamore for conceiving of and implementing draggable overlays.</li>
                <li>Carl Nogueira and Terry Gray for initial testing of LOS Checking in Stalingrad. Chris Doary for tireless rules explanations that helped us understand what the LOS code needed to do.</li>

          <h3>New in version 6.3.0:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Hakkaa P&auml;&auml;lle Counters!
              <ul>
                <li>You've waited long enough, but now it's time to slap on some virtual skis and tackle that electronic Motti. Enjoy!</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Automatic board synchronization!
              <ul>
                <li>Have an out of date copy of a board? No worries - VASL now grabs the latest board from the repository when you create or open a game. Missing a board altogether? Not a problem - the missing board will be copied to your board directory and you're off and running.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Other enhancements:
              <ul>
                <li>More reminders for special die rolls were added to the QC dice buttons. Unlikely hits, Multiple hits, turret vs. hull... stuff like that.</li>
                <li>Partial support for LOS checking when using overlays was added. LOS checking is only disabled if it touches the overlay outline.</li>
                <li>Mark Unmoved button was moved to the left so it won't "disappear" on smaller screens.</li>
                <li>Free*French support weapons were copied to the British counter mix.</li>
                <li>Moving HIP units no longer reports "? -> ?" to the chatter.</li>
                <li>Scenario*specific overlays were added to boards 3 and 19 for scenarios J44 and OB3.</li>
                <li>Gutted factories, ground snow, and a non-rubbled Chemist shop were added to the RBv2 board. In addition some missing sewers were found and returned to their rightful location.</li>
                <li>HIP option was added to all counters. You never know...</li>
                <li>The code that handles the SSR terrain changes was completely gutted "under the covers." Keep your eyes open for any problems when applying terrain changes, cropping, etc.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Bug fixes:
              <ul>
                <li>The "disappearing" counters and stacks bug should finally (!) be fixed.</li>
                <li>Snap points were missing on deluxe boards.</li>
                <li>LOS checks no longer lose the chatter focus when stepping through a log file.</li>
                <li>Hungarian Vehicle Crews had the wrong morale.</li>
                <li>"Crags to palm trees" SSR transformation was not working on some boards.</li>
                <li>"Woods-Roads - Fill in with woods" SSR transformation was not working on some boards.</li>
                <li>Bocage incorrectly blocked LOS to some higher elevations.</li>
                <li>Japanese crews and SMCs were missing Prep Fire and First Fire options.</li>
                <li>Smoke exponents on Chinese Type 89 MTR were wrong.</li>
                <li>The labels on the CA counters were in the wrong position.</li>
                <li>Bad hex sizes on BFP boards bug were fixed.</li>
                <li>Blank boards (all white boards with a hex grid) are available. They're great for setups and when you need a little elbow room on the board.</li>

          <h4>Enhancements</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>LOS improvements:
              <ul>
                <li>LOS support has been added for the following boards and
                  <ul>
                    <li>a-h</li>
                    <li>1a/1b-9a/9b</li>
                    <li>BFP boards</li>

                  <p>Get all of the <a href="boards/v6boards1-67.zip" rel="nofollow">updated boards</a>, and unzip the file into your boards folder.</p>
                  <p>PTO terrain transformations have also been added to the LOS engine.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Fixed a bug where LOS checks did not show on your opponent's board.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Board Cropper, Overlay, and Terrain Transformation dialogs now have a a pulldown that includes only selected boards.</li>
            <li>The new American 2-6 LMG from Rising Sun was added.</li>
            <li>The Quick Counter extension has been integrated into VASL. You no longer need to download and install the extension.
              <p>The Quick Counter toolbar can be customized, additional instances can be created and enabled.</p>
            </li>
            <li>The map border has been extended from 200 pixels to 400 pixels.
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">Important Note:</span>Both players must use Version 6.2 for
                the extended border to function. Extending the border causes all pieces in existing games to be offset by 200
                pixels. You can fix this problem by selecting all counters (drag the mouse across the entire map), and then
                dragging one counter back into place. This correction does not work for draggable overlays and entrenchment
                counters. You must move these overlays and counters manually.</p>
            </li>
            <li>The Show Map button now has three states: Show All, Hide Pieces (only), Hide all (pieces and draggable overlays).</li>
            <li>The stack expander now shows the terrain under the stack.</li>
            <li>Installation documentation has been revised and enhanced.</li>
            <li>Documentation for LOS checking has been added.</li>

                <li>The German 5-4-8 Assault Engineer squad image has been corrected.</li>
                <li>Broken side morale of the black Waffen SS 5--8 Assault Engineer has been corrected.</li>
                <li>Churchill AVRE no longer generates a Pin counter when removing the Fascine.</li>
