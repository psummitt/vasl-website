      <p>VASL is not the result of a single person's effort, but has grown out of the cooperation of a large number of
      people over time. There are many niches, large and small, for anybody interested in contributing. The VASL
      Cooperative is a collection of people who contribute map artwork, counter artwork, scenario setups, web support,
      and/or Java programming. Or people just interested in an inside or advance view of what's happening with VASL.</p>

      <img src="images/octocat.jpg" class="pull-right" alt="GitHub" />

      <p><a href="http://www.vassalengine.org/" target="_blank">VASSAL</a> modules are highly customizable. This means
      that it's possible for anybody to make enhancements to VASL. Got some third-party counters you'd like to contribute?
      Now it's easy! By using VASSAL's module editor, you can create your own custom extensions, with whatever new
      counters you like, then post it on the web site for others to enjoy!<br> </p>

      <p>For even more ambitious people, VASL source code is publicly available <a
      href="https://github.com/vasl-developers/vasl">source code</a>. Got a pet feature you'd like to add to VASL? Now you
      can write your own Java code and plug it straight in! Look at the 'docs' directory in the VASSAL download for
      documentation on the interface and a tutorial on how to do it. And of course, the VASL developers are more than
      willing to help you get comfortable. Find a problem or looking for ideas?&nbsp; Check the VASL <a

      <h3>Current Development of VASL!</h3>

      <h3>VASL6.6.4</h3>

      <p>VASL6.6.4 is now officially released. Get it from the downloads page.<br> </p>

      <!--<div class="well table">
        <a id="download664beta" class="track btn btn-large btn-primary" href="modules/VASLv664beta.zip">VASL 6.6.4-beta5</a>

      </div> -->

      <h3>VASL6.6.5</h3>

      <p>Development for VASL6.6.5 is currently underway. Our <a href="https://github.com/vasl-developers/vasl/issues">Issues List </a>
      on Github usually contains about 100 items, a combination of desired features, known bugs, and board related items. Not all are
      being worked on at any given time. The current plan for 6.6.5 is to focus on new feature development and looks like this: <br> </p>

      <img src="images/jb_beam.png" class="pull-right" alt="GitHub" />

      <p>New Features</p>
      <li>Enable the VASL chat window to work with html</li>
      <li>Create, link, and label acquisition counters from a vehicle/gun popup menu with one click</li>
      <li>Display a "Recent Games Played" list at Startup and on the File Menu</li>
      <li>Add a Version Converter that will update previously saved games to new versions</li>
      <li>Develop a new way to move and display vehicles in bypass</li>
      <li>Have the LOS engine check for obstacles on both sides of the LOS thread as per ASL rules</li>
      <li>Continue to streamline board files</li>
      <br>
      <p>Some of these may prove to be too difficult to implement or may risk creating many bugs and so may fall by the wayside. <br></p>

      <p>Bug Fixes</p>
      <p>Cas Bin bug: when sending a HS to the bin, clicking on "CR and Send" or "ELR, CR, and Send" will send a full squad to the bin and leave a squad behind.<br></p>
      <p>LOS bug: when drawing los to/from cellar location from/to non-adjacent location that crosses a wall/hexside, los was not being blocked</p>
      <br>
      <p><b><span style="color: red">Update: April 2022  </span></b>VASL6.6.5-beta1 will likely be available in May 2022 and should contain some progress on the second feature: managing acquisiton counters.</p>
      <p>Good progress has been made on the last feature, steamline board files. As we simplify the board creation process, we can produce new boards with less effort and errors. At present this means for users lots of automatic board updates. Let us know if you see any board erroors.</p>
      <br>
      <p>VASL6.6.5 should be officially released in the Fall of 2022.</p>

      <p><i>VASL code development is currently carried out using free software tools provided by Jet Brains as part of it's
