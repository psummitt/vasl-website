      <p>VASL is not the result of a single person's effort, but has grown out of the cooperation of a large number of
      people over time. There are many niches, large and small, for anybody interested in contributing. The VASL
      Cooperative is a collection of people who contribute map artwork, counter artwork, scenario setups, web support,
      and/or Java programming. Or people just interested in an inside or advance view of what's happening with VASL.</p>

      <h3>Customize VASL!</h3>

      <img src="images/octocat.jpg" class="pull-right" alt="GitHub" />

      <p><a href="http://www.vassalengine.org/" target="_blank">VASSAL</a> modules are highly customizable. This means
      that it's possible for anybody to make enhancements to VASL. Got some third-party counters you'd like to contribute?
      Now it's easy! By using VASSAL's module editor, you can create your own custom extensions, with whatever new
      counters you like, then post it on the web site for others to enjoy!<br> </p>

      <p>For even more ambitious people, VASL source code is publicly available <a
      href="https://github.com/vasl-developers/vasl">source code</a>. Got a pet feature you'd like to add to VASL? Now you
      can write your own Java code and plug it straight in! Look at the 'docs' directory in the VASSAL download for
      documentation on the interface and a tutorial on how to do it. And of course, the VASL developers are more than
      willing to help you get comfortable. Find a problem or looking for ideas?&nbsp; Check the VASL <a

      <h3>Current Development of VASL!</h3>

      <h3>VASL6.6.8</h3>

      <p>VASL6.6.8-beta9 is released. Get it here.<br> </p>

      <div class="well table">
        <a id="download668" class="track btn btn-large btn-primary" href="https://github.com/vasl-developers/vasl/releases/tag/vasl-6.6.8-beta9.vmod">VASL 6.6.8-beta9.vmod</a>
      </div>

      <h3>VASL6.6.8-beta9</h3>

      <p>Development for VASL6.6.8 is currently underway. Our <a href="https://github.com/vasl-developers/vasl/issues">Issues List </a>
      on Github usually contains about 150 items, a combination of desired features, known bugs, and board related items. Not all are
      being worked on at any given time. The current plan for 6.6.8 is to focus on bug fixes - many of you are good to point out these bugs
      and the next version will focus on fixing as many as possible. 667 included the addition of a Game Updater tool to allow setup files
      created in earlier versions and saved games from earlier versions to be easily updated to the features and functionality available
      in the latest VASL version. Please be sure to flag any problems you have when using this tool. </p>

      <p><b>Game Converter Development Plan Overview</b></p>

	  <p>In order to preserve the “enduring nature” of the Game Converter process there will be an impact on future VASL development planning and scheduling. After 6.6.6, new VASL versions will only include changes that will not break Setup Files or Saved Games. New features that impact version compatibility will be added only once an enduring Converter is in place. </p>
      <p>VASSAL’s development also has an impact on these issues. Changes in VASSAL may affect VASL’s ability to provide backwards compatibility. The current practice of having multiple VASL and/or VASSAL versions installed at one time provides some assurance to VASL users that older games will remain useable.</p>
      <p>The plan is to target VASL 6.7.0 for implementing the Game Converter tool in such a way that setup files could be automatically updated in bulk to the next version. Between VASL versions 6.6.7 and 6.7.0, the Game Converter tool would be applied to setup files individually to check for errors.  Saved games are best converted individually when they are opened. Players will have the option to update or not. </p>
      <p>Proposed Plan of Action</p>
      <p>Fall 2024 Release VASL6.6.9</p>
      <p>It will include the second iteration of the Game Converter process. All games will automatically use the latest version of boards and overlays. Updating previously saved games will update counters and los checking per VASL6.6.7, and will also support checking for and updating of extensions required for the .vsav and additional means to grab and display external content. </p>
      <p>Spring 2025 Release VASL6.7.0</p>
      <p>The final version of the Game Converter will provide enhancements and modifications to all of the previous functionality. At this point, it should be possible to implement batch updating of setup files whenever a new VASL version is released so that these files would always be available with the latest functionality and improvements. </p>
 
	  <p>VASL6.6.8 should be officially released in the Spring of 2024.</p>
