      <p>VASL is not the result of a single person's effort, but has grown out of the cooperation of a large number of
      people over time. There are many niches, large and small, for anybody interested in contributing. The VASL
      Cooperative is a collection of people who contribute map artwork, counter artwork, scenario setups, web support,
      and/or Java programming. Or people just interested in an inside or advance view of what's happening with VASL.</p>

      <h3>Customize VASL!</h3>

      <img src="images/octocat.jpg" class="pull-right" alt="GitHub" />

      <p><a href="http://www.vassalengine.org/" target="_blank">VASSAL</a> modules are highly customizable. This means
      that it's possible for anybody to make enhancements to VASL. Got some third-party counters you'd like to contribute?
      Now it's easy! By using VASSAL's module editor, you can create your own custom extensions, with whatever new
      counters you like, then post it on the web site for others to enjoy!<br> </p>

      <p>For even more ambitious people, VASL source code is publicly available <a
      href="https://github.com/vasl-developers/vasl">source code</a>. Got a pet feature you'd like to add to VASL? Now you
      can write your own Java code and plug it straight in! Look at the 'docs' directory in the VASSAL download for
      documentation on the interface and a tutorial on how to do it. And of course, the VASL developers are more than
      willing to help you get comfortable. Find a problem or looking for ideas?&nbsp; Check the VASL <a

      <h3>Current Development of VASL!</h3>

      <h3>VASL6.6.9</h3>

      <p>VASL6.6.9-beta7 is released. Get it here.<br> </p>

      <div class="well table">
        <a id="download669" class="track btn btn-large btn-primary" href="https://github.com/vasl-developers/vasl/releases/tag/v6.6.9-beta7">VASL 6.6.9-beta7.vmod</a>
      </div>

      <h3>VASL6.6.9-beta7</h3>

      <p>Development for VASL6.6.9 is currently underway. Our <a href="https://github.com/vasl-developers/vasl/issues">Issues List </a>
      on Github usually contains about 150 items, a combination of desired features, known bugs, and board related items. Not all are
      being worked on at any given time. </p>
      <p>This beta version is a minor bug fix version that adds additional bug fixes to prevent crashes caused by BoardZoomer and makes minor changes to the Auto-Reveal HIP Fortification feature.</p>
      <p>It also includes the Railcar and 458/248 NKVD counters for TotR which were recently issued in an extension.</p>
      <p>It contains all of the fixes from beta2 that largely solve the "jumpimg counter" bug introduced in 6.6.8. Counter movement will return to normal although when counters are dragged onto the map window
      for the first time, they may still offset to a bypass position in the intended hex. They can be moved to the proper position and will behave normally thereafter. We hope to fix this
      minor issue in future 6.6.9 betas.</p>
      <p>The Auto-detection of HIP Fortification counters by moving units feature was also added . It can be enabled/disabled in File -> Preferences -> VASL. Initially the
      preference is set to On. This feature will detect and reveal Hidden Fortifications as per one part of A12.34 - when an enemy unit gains los to them.</p>

      <p>The game mechanics are this:</p>

      <p>1. A player sets up one or more HIP fortifications (for now it works with Foxhole, Trench, A-T Ditch, PFZ and Wire counters).</p>
      <p>2. The opposing player moves a (Good Order) unit counter such that it has los to one or more of the HIP fortifications.</p>
      <p>3. The player who HIPped the fortification (only) will see a popup alert on screen asking if the fortification should be revealed or not. There are many good and valid reasons to say no.</p>
      <p>4. If the owning player says yes to the reveal, the counter will appear onboard (for both players) and the reveal will be reported in the chat window.</p>
      <p>5. If the owning player says no to the reveal, the other player will never know anything happened.</p>
      <p>6. If only one player is involved in the game, the tool should not work at all. Same as current behaviour.</p>
      <p>7. Concealed stacks will trigger to popup alert. If the moving player is unwilling to confirm presence of a real unit, the opponent should respond No to the reveal question.</p>

      <p>Further development of the feature could include its application to additional fortification types and to different "reveal" rules - Night, PTO.</p>
      <p>6.6.9-beta7 also includes a couple of other bug fixes: the Disable Full Color Stacks preference is now working again, a ghosting bug when drag-dropping is now fixed for linux users. See "What's New" in the Help menu when using VASL.</p>
      <p>The current plan for 6.6.9 is to focus on new features such reworking AFV popup menus and starting to use SVG images in counters
      - this will be a major step forward in image clarity but increases complexity and workload and so will be implemented in stages. </p>

      <p><b>Game Converter Development Plan Overview</b></p>

	  <p>In order to preserve the “enduring nature” of the Game Converter process there will be an impact on future VASL development planning and scheduling. After 6.6.6, new VASL versions will only include changes that will not break Setup Files or Saved Games. New features that impact version compatibility will be added only once an enduring Converter is in place. </p>
      <p>VASSAL’s development also has an impact on these issues. Changes in VASSAL may affect VASL’s ability to provide backwards compatibility. The current practice of having multiple VASL and/or VASSAL versions installed at one time provides some assurance to VASL users that older games will remain useable.</p>
      <p>The plan was to target VASL 6.7.0 for implementing the Game Converter tool in such a way that setup files could be automatically updated in bulk to the next version. Between VASL versions 6.6.7 and 6.7.0, the Game Converter tool would be applied to setup files individually to check for errors.  Saved games are best converted individually when they are opened. Players will have the option to update or not. </p>
      <p>Revised Plan of Action</p>
      <p>Summer 2024 Release Scenario Setup files extension for 6.6.8</p>
      <p>This extension is now available and includes 400 Scenario Setup files uppdated to 6.6.8 functionality.</p>
      <p>Fall 2024 Release VASL6.6.9</p>
      <p>It will include the second iteration of the Game Converter process. All games will automatically use the latest version of boards and overlays. Updating previously saved games will update counters and los checking per VASL6.6.7, and will also support checking for and updating of extensions required for the .vsav and additional means to grab and display external content. </p>
      <p>The Scenario Setup files extension will be updated to 6.6.9 functionality and released at the same time as the VASL module. This will be the pattern from now on.</p>
      <p>Spring 2025 Release VASL6.7.0</p>
      <p>The final version of the Game Converter will provide enhancements and modifications to all of the previous functionality.</p>
