      <p>VASL is not the result of a single person's effort, but has grown out of the cooperation of a large number of
      people over time. There are many niches, large and small, for anybody interested in contributing. The VASL
      Cooperative is a collection of people who contribute map artwork, counter artwork, scenario setups, web support,
      and/or Java programming. Or people just interested in an inside or advance view of what's happening with VASL.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.vassalengine.org/" target="_blank">VASSAL</a> modules are highly customizable. This means
      that it's possible for anybody to make enhancements to VASL. Got some third-party counters you'd like to contribute?
      Now it's easy! By using VASSAL's module editor, you can create your own custom extensions, with whatever new
      counters you like, then post it on the web site for others to enjoy!<br> </p>

      <p>For even more ambitious people, VASL source code is publicly available <a
      href="https://github.com/vasl-developers/vasl">source code</a>. Got a pet feature you'd like to add to VASL? Now you
      can write your own Java code and plug it straight in! Look at the 'docs' directory in the VASSAL download for
      documentation on the interface and a tutorial on how to do it. And of course, the VASL developers are more than
      willing to help you get comfortable. Find a problem or looking for ideas?&nbsp; Check the VASL <a

      <h3>VASL6.6.5</h3>

      <p>VASL6.6.5 is now officially released. Get it from the downloads page.<br> </p>

      <div class="well table">

      <h3>VASL6.6.6</h3>

      <p>Development for VASL6.6.6 is currently underway. Our <a href="https://github.com/vasl-developers/vasl/issues">Issues List </a>
      on Github usually contains about 100 items, a combination of desired features, known bugs, and board related items. Not all are
      being worked on at any given time. The current plan for 6.6.6 is to focus on bug fixes and to return to new feature development in 6.6.7.<br> </p>

      <img src="images/jb_beam.png" class="pull-right" alt="GitHub" />

      <p>Bug Fixes Planned for VASL6.6.6:</p>
      <p>Cas Bin bug: when sending a HS to the bin, clicking on "CR and Send" or "ELR, CR, and Send" will send a full squad to the bin and leave a squad behind.<br></p>
      <p>Chinese LMG(j) doesn't show Malf'd side.</p>
      <p>Foxholes and Trench negate LOS Hindrance in grain and brush.</p>
      <p>Overlay 4 bugs.</p>
      <p>LOS button greyed out permanently.</p>
      <p>ELR Bug.</p>
      <p>Los bug with gullies on bdodx.</p>
      <p>Setting terrain to DTO toggles on too many options.</p>
      <p>LOS thread confused by transform of hill to grain.</p>
      <p>Remove upper levels in LOS engine when adding Gutted Factory overlays.</p>
      <p>ASLDicebot.java update.</p>
      <p>Clean up board archive and board picker code files.</p>
      <p>Night effect does not size correctly.</p>
      <p>Some Finnish broken squads switches to unbroken HS.</p>
      <p>More robust marsh to water transformation.</p>
      <br>	
      <p>As always, some of these may fall by the wayside as work progresses. </p>
      <br>
      <p>VASL6.6.6 should be officially released in the Spring of 2023.</p>
