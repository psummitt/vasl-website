            <h2>Step 1 - Creating a Room</h2>

            <p>In order to start a new game it will be necessary for you to create a Scenario Room for you and your opponent to
            play. In the Server window. type the name you wish your room to have into the &quot;New Game&quot; field and press
            <b>Enter</b> on your keyboard. You should now be the sole occupant of that room. If you enter the same name as a
            currently-ongoing scenario, you will join that room instead.</p>

            <p><b>NOTE:</b> It is considered bad etiquette to start up a scenario in the middle of the Main
            Room. This is the meeting area for players entering VASL, not a place to play your game! </p>

            <p>While connected to a scenario chat room, all moves are broadcast to all players and maps are updated
            automatically. You can save and restore the game to files on your local machine. If your map and your opponent's map
            appear to differ (e.g. due to lost moves during a broken connection), synchronizing by right clicking on your
            opponent's name and selecting <b>&quot;Synchronize&quot;</b> will update your map to coincide with your
            opponent's.</p>

          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr align="left" valign="top">
          <td colspan="2">
            <h2 name="loading">Step 2 - Loading the Scenario</h2>

            <p>First, check the <a href="../scenarios.htm">VASL scenario setup archive</a> for the
            scenario you want to play. Many official scenarios have been compiled by volunteers. Download the file, then from
            the VASL controls window choose <b>File - Load Game</b> and select the scenario file, and you'll have both sides' OB
            in front of you, ready for the Defender's setup. (If you're not setting up a scenario from scratch, proceed to the
            instructions on <a href="./06.htm#placement">placing your counters</a>.)</p>

            <p>If the scenario you are playing doesn't exist in the archive, you can create the setup yourself. Choose <b>File -
            New Game</b>. The Choose Boards window will appear asking you to select the maps you will use in the game.</p>

            <h2 name="maps">Step 3 - Mapboards</h2>

            <p>Select the mapboard you are going to use for the scenario from the drop down list. All available boards will appear
            in the list. Once a board has been selected, VASL will check to ensure that the latest version of the board exists in
            player's \boards directory and will download a new or updated version if required. The version number of the board
            appears with the name of the board in the Chat Window after it has been loaded (e.g. &quot;Loaded board 2 (version
            6.3)&quot;).<br> </p>

            <p>To add another board, select whether it will be placed horizontally (<b>Add Row</b>) or vertically (<b>Add
            Column</b>). If the map needs to be reversed (rotated), check the <b>Reverse</b> checkbox. If you made a mistake
            setting up the maps. you can click the <b>Clear</b> button, to reset the window so you can start again.</p>

            <p>Once the maps are correctly placed you also have the ability to crop the maps. To crop a map, click on the
            <b>Crop Boards</b> button. A new window will appear. Enter the board number to be cropped (if there is more than
            one) and then enter the coordinates to be removed (leaving the fields blank will leave the height or width
            untouched). Press the <b>Crop</b> button to complete the operation and finish by pressing the <b>Done</b> button. To
            un-crop a board, type in the board number, and press <b>Crop</b>. Without any coordinates, it will restore the board
            to its original condition. If you desire, you can create extra space around a board by cropping to offboard
            coordinates. Negative numbers and negative letters are valid (for example, cropping coordinates -3 to 10 will add 3
            hexes of blank space above the board, while cropping hexrows -d to gg will add 3 hexes to the left of the
            board).</p>

            <p><b>Overlays</b> are available by typing in the overlay name and hexes as they appear on a scenario card. You
            don't need to specify a board number if there is only one board. Some overlays, such as E1 and 4, require no
            coordinates. You should see the overlays on your Choose Boards window as they are added. Overlay files have version
            numbers in case they need to be updated (which will happen automatically as with boards). The version number is displayed when the overlay is added.</p>

            <p>Add ocean and beach overlays as though they were ordinary overlays, using hexes xx01 and xx02 as the
            &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; hexes. As with cropping, negative numbers and negative letters are legal for
            offboard placement hexes. Since Beach and Ocean overlays often extend off the edge of a board, you will need to
            either add space by cropping (see above) or place a blank board under the overlays.</p>

            <p><b>Terrain changes</b> are alterations to the mapboards according to special rules that comonly appear in
            scenarios. They allow you to completely alter the look of the geomorphic boards by putting down ground snow,
            removing grain or roads, applying PTO terrain, etc. </p>

            <p>Press the <b>Terrain SSR</b> button, use the controls to make your selection and hit the <b>Apply</b> button. Hit
            the <b>Done</b> button when finished.</p>

            <p>Like overlays, boards are given version numbers for possible future updates. The version number is displayed when
            you open the Terrain SSR window. When you connect to the VASL server, VASL will automatically check the version
            numbers of the boards in play against the latest version. If your copies are found to be out of date, VASL will
            download and install the latest versions.</p>

            <p>Once you are done setting up the boards, press the <b>Done</b> button to begin setting up the counters.</p>

            <p>(If you wish to change mapboards after having begun setup, you may do so by clicking the ASL dropdown menu button
            and then selecting "Pick new boards for this scenario.</p>

            window will appear on the screen. The Counters window, which allows you to select new counters you wish to place on
            the map, will present in the toolbar. To select from the various information counters, click on the <b>Info</b> tab
            in the Counters window or drag them from the Quick Counter toolbar. To
            select from the unit counters of the various nationalities, click on the <b>Units</b> tab of the Counters window.</p>

            <p>All the information and unit counters used in ASL are available in VASL. If you cannot find one either in the
            Counter window or QC toolbar, try to flip a related counter by right-clicking on the counter and selecting
            &quot;<b>Flip</b>&quot; from the pop-up menu, or clicking on the counter and hitting <b>Ctrl+F</b>). The popup menu may offer
            other options to change to the counter that you wish (ie squad to hs, Battle Harden a Unit, DFF to Final Fire.  To place that
            counter on the map, simply click and drag the image from the Counter window onto the map.</p>

            <h2 name="handling">Handling the Counters</h2>

            <p>The key to handling counters in VASL is <i>selecting</i> them. In order to perform any action on any counter
            placed on the board it is necessary to select the counter to be acted upon. </p>

            <p><b>Selecting an Individual Counter:</b> Left-click on the counter, a black outline will appear around the edge of
            the counter.</p>

            <p><b>Selecting a Stack of Counters</b>: To select a stack of counters, left-click on the top counter of the
            stack.</p>

            <p><b>Expanding a Stack of Counters:</b> Stacks are normally drawn compacted, i.e. with only the top counter
            showing. An expanded view of a stack can be seen by double-clicking on it. <font color="#CCCCCC">(Mac users hold
            down the apple key)</font> To select individual counters of a stack, hold down the shift key as you click on each
            counter of the expanded stack. Each counter you select will have a black outline.</p>

            <p><b>Collapsing a Stack of Counters:</b> When you wish to collapse a stack in order to return it to its compacted
            view, simply double-click on the expanded stack.</p>

            <p><b>Selecting Only the Top Counter in a Stack of Counters:</b> When you wish to select on the topmost counter of a stack in order, right-click it.
            Concealing that counter will add one ? counter to the top of the stack, while marking the lower counters as concealed (which displays them to the
            opposing player as concealment counters. </p>

            <p><b>Counter Actions:</b> Once you have selected the counter(s) or stacks you wish to act upon, you may take the
            following actions by using the corresponding key commands. You may also right-click (Mac users hold down the command
            [apple] key while clicking) on a counter for a pop-up menu with all available commands for that counter.</p>

            <p><a name="labels"><b>LABELS:</b></a> Whereas on a physical board, many things need to be indicated with a counter,
            in VASL that information can be more convenient if made into a label. For example, labeling a unit
            &quot;Fanatic,&quot; &quot;Berserk,&quot; or &quot;Wounded&quot; saves you from having to drag around an extra
            counter. For vehicles, use the labels for vehicle ID numbers (matched with labels on acquisition counters), HD
            status on crest lines, or armor leaders. To label a counter, simply select
            the counter and press <b>CTRL + L</b>. Type in the information you wish that counter to display and press
            <b>Enter</b>. To edit the contents of a counter label simply select the counter and press <b>CTRL + L</b>.</p>

            <p><a name="info"><b>SPECIAL INFORMATION:</b></a> Special ammo information for guns and vehicles is not written on
            the backs of the counters, but can be seen by selecting the counter and typing <b>CTRL +I</b>. Type <b>CTRL +I</b>
            again to hide the info. While the info is displayed, BU/CE counters are drawn underneath the vehicle counter so that
            you can read the front.</p>

            <p><a name="concealment"><b>CONCEALMENT:</b></a> When concealed, your units will appear with a &quot;?&quot; in the
            upper left corner. To your opponent, all concealed counters look like dummy (&quot;?&quot;) counters. A HIP counter is invisible to
            your opponent. Your own HIP counters are drawn on your map in a semi-transparent manner with HIP stacks appearing
            against a white background.</p>

            <p>Placing a &quot;?&quot; counter on top of a stack will conceal all of your units beneath it. Removing or
            repositioning a &quot;?&quot; counter will unconceal units accordingly. Because of special cases that may arise
            (usually involving multiple Locations in a hex), units may also be concealed and unconcealed individually, so
            concealed status is not strictly linked to a unit's position in a stack.</p>

            <p><b>CLEANING UP:</b> VASL allows you to quickly delete all the phase based information counters. Choose Remove All
            from the top of the VASL map window. A sub-menu will appear listing all the information counters that can be quickly
            deleted at once.</p>

            <h2 name="tips">Tips and Tricks</h2>

            <p>At setup, place your entire OB off board (on the grey area outside the map) before putting units on the boards,
            to more easily keep track of what you have available.</p>

            <p>To merge concealed stacks, move counters into their destination stack one at a time. Otherwise, your counters
            will be momentarily revealed when you delete the top concealment counter. When entering units from off board, first
            place everything into one or two stacks, conceal them, and then split off individual units into stacks for
            entry.</p>

            <p>Night scenarios are particularly convenient when using VASL, since the Defender can keep his HIP units on his
            screen during play. The Attacker can place stacks of HIP units under his cloaking counters to avoid having to using
            the cloaking display.</p>

            <p>Be sure to check the <a href="../scenarios.htm" >VASL scenario setup archive</a> for your scenario first. One of
            the most time consuming parts of playing ASL face-to-face is setting up, but loading a savefile into VASL takes no
            time at all, and of course, putting the scenario away is even faster! </p>
