            <h2>Playing Tools</h2>

            <p>All Playing Tools for VASL are accessible either from the top of the VASL Controls window, or from the top of the
            VASL Map window.</p>

          <td valign="top">
            <h2 name="info">Scenario Info Window</h2>

            <p>The Scenario Info window allows you to keep track of the what turn it is, who moves first, SAN numbers, and ELR
            ratings. There is also a notes area that allows you to keep track of information such as Victory Conditions, Play
            Balance used, etc. The Private Note area is a a way to keep private notes for yourself during the course of the
            game.</p>

          <td colspan="2">
            <h2>OBA Draw Piles</h2>

            <p>Click the <b>OBA</b> button at the top of the VASL Controls window. The OBA Modules window will appear. Push the
            <b>Add Module</b> button to create a new (empty) deck for making OBA draws. When your opponent creates a module, you
            will simply see a deck of cards which you can not modify. Otherwise, you may type in the number of red and black
            cards in the areas provided (and hit enter). Click the mouse on the deck to turn up a random card from the pile.
            Click on an exposed card to shuffle it back into the deck. The OBA draw pile information is shared between users
            just like counter positions, and is retained when the scenario is saved. To delete a module, set the number of red
            and black cards both to zero.</p>

            <h2>Dice/Die Rollers</h2>

            <p>Click on one of the dice/die buttons at the bottom of the Chat Window to trigger a dice/die roll. By selecting action-specific
              buttons such as IFT or TH various messages will be triggered when the results are shown. Preferences-> Chat Window tab
              contains a variety of options for customizing dice/die rolling, including the choice of dicebot. </p>

            <h2>QRDC</h2>

            <p>VASL also contains a computerized version of several charts to aid your play. Select the <b>QRDC</b> button at the top
            of the VASL Controls window to launch the QRDC. Both IFT and IIFT are present on the table. Simply click on the
            corresponding tab to switch from one to the other, or to the Close Combat, Ordnance To Hit and Vehicle To Kill
            charts.</p>

            <h2>Checking LOS</h2>

            <li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../los/out/src/t_checking_los.html">Checking Line of sight (LOS)</a></strong><br/>

            <h2>Mark All Unmoved&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

            <p>If you have checked <b>Mark Moved Units</b> in the Preferences, click <b>Mark unmoved</b> at the top of the VASL
            map window to delete the &quot;Moved&quot; notation of all stacks.</p>


            <h2>Save Map as GIF File&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

            <p>This will save the image of the map and counters into a GIF file. It is the same as a screen capture except that
            the entire map need not be showing on your screen. <font color="#CCCCCC">The file is written in PPM format (sorry).
            The files will be large (~ 3 MB for a single board), but you should be able to load them into any graphics program
            and convert them to GIF format, which will reduce the size by a factor of 10. If you don't have such a program,
            there's a web site that can do it for you.</font></p>


            <h2>Save Map as Text&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

            <p>This will write an ASCII file giving a hex-by-hex summary of the contents of the map. You will be prompted to
            choose whether or not to output the locations and content of your hidden and concealed units.</p>


            <h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>

            <p>Almost every action VASL can be carried out by using the mouse and by using a keystroke combination (often called
            a key command or hotkey). To view the currently available hotkeys, select Hotkey Listing from the Help menu in VASL.</p>
