            <p>VASL can be a great analytical tool for planning out your next ASL game. Start VASL the way you normally do and
            do not connect to the server. Set up your scenarios and tweak your placements! No counters to pick up, no messes to
            clean. When you are ready for your face-to-face game, simply expand every stack and take a screen shot of the VASL
            window. Then print your screen capture! A very neat way to set up your games ahead of time. Windows users can easily
            print their VASL screens by pressing the Print Screen button above the Insert key on their keyboard. Then open any
            program that allows cutting and pasting (Paintbrush, even your word processor) and paste the image. Once pasted in,
            you can easily print the graphic. VASL users that use the program on other operating systems can use shareware
            screen capture programs to accomplish the same thing. </p>

            <p><i>Many thanks to Lars Thuring and Gary Milks!</i></p>

            <p>On of the nicest features of VASL is how it enables users to quickly and efficiently play ASL via the mail
            (e-mail that is). VASL allows you to not only save the scenario as an attachable file, but it also keeps a Log File
            of each of the actions taken by the players, so you can step through the action move by move. </p>

            <h3>Preparing your E-Mail program</h3>

            <p>When you play VASL by email logfile exchange, a problem can crop up when your email program wraps long text lines
            onto the next line (i.e., the "word wrap" feature). VASL logfiles are solid blocks of text, and if an email
            application word wraps a logfile, VASL will report "Invalid savefile" when trying to load it. </p>

            <p>Most email utilities allow you to turn off the word-wrap feature for individual mailings - in Eudora Pro, simply
            uncheck the "word wrap" icon that appears at the top of new message and any logfile attachments will not be
            word-wrapped.</p>

            <p>In desperate situations, word-wrapped logfiles can be edited with a text editor - usually simply deleting the
            line breaks inserted by the mail program will repair it. &nbsp;Be sure there are also no linebreaks at the end of
            the file either!</p>

            <h3>File naming conventions</h3>

            <p>Some file naming convention between yourself and your opponent will be necessary... here is a suggestion:
            "[scenario#]-[turn #]-[side]-[phase] .vasl"</p>

            <h3>The Log File</h3>

            <p>Postal VASL is achieved through the mailing back and forth of a Log File. <font color="#cccccc">The Logging
            feature must be turned on to capture the moves.</font> Create a logfile by selecting <b>Begin Logfile</b> from the
            <b>File</b> menu at the top of the VASL Control window. The current map position will be saved, and VASL will record
            all your moves, actions, and comments. They will be seen by your opponent as (s)he <b>Steps</b> through the log
            file. Hitting the <b>Undo</b> button will back you up to the last move, but your text comments will not be erased.
            When finished with your moves, select <b>End Log</b> from the <b>File</b> menu to save the moves into a file using
            the above naming system. Be sure you give the logfile a different name from the scenario savefile or you will
            overwrite the savefile.</p>

            <h3>Sending the Log File</h3>

            <p>After closing the log file, exit VASL and start your mail program. Create a message to your opponent and, if
            possible, attach the log file (as an attachment, there is less chance that the log file will be mangled by line
            wraps). If attachments are not possible, the log file can opened in a text editor (Notepad or SimpleText) and the
            contents pasted into the message body </p>

            <h3>Stepping through a Log File</h3>

            <p>Upon receiving a VASL log in email, save the attachment (or copy and paste the VASL log into your text editor and
            save it) into the subfolder for the scenario. Your opponent activates the logfile by choosing it after selecting
            <b>File &gt; Load Game</b>. A logfile is technically just a savefile with moves tacked onto the end, so if the file
            contains moves the <b>Step</b> button will appear automatically. If the button does not appear, there are no moves
            recorded in that file. </p>

            <p>Each time you hit the <b>Step</b> button, a single move or comment will be executed until the end of the file is
            reached. The <b>Undo</b> button takes you back to the last move. Step through your opponent's log file until you see
            something to which you wish to respond (a comment, an error, or a defensive first fire opportunity). Back up to the
            location where you wish to start logging (possibly several lines back where the target unit starts moving) and write
            a new logfile. As you now step through your opponent's logfile, his moves will be echoed into the logfile you are
            creating. Step down to show your opponent's comment/error/move, then enter your response. [Note: the reason for not
            writing your log immediately after loading your opponent's is to avoid copying your opponent's valid actions to your
            log file unnecessarily and thus to keep each log file to the minimum size possible.] If your response significantly
            changes the situation in the game, end the log and send the logfile to your opponent for any adjustments. Otherwise,
            enter the actions for your phase(s), end the log and exit VASL. </p>

            <p>If playing or observing a live game on the server, a logfile may be opened to record the game as it
            progresses.</p>

            <h3>Honor System</h3>

            <p>Like all mail/email games, a version of the "On My Honor" rules will be used<font color="#cccccc"> (see the
            FAQ)</font>. For instance, the players must agree not to step through the log file to determine the best defensive
            first fire opportunities before applying the shots. They must also agree to stop stepping through their opponent's
            MPh if a significant defensive action takes place. In other words, both players must agree to play the log file as
            it comes. So no peeking!</p>

            <h2 name="etiquette">D. Etiquette</h2>

            <p>VASL is not just an interface for playing ASL over the Internet, its a social environment as well. Please
            remember to act accordingly. </p>

            <h3>Simple Rules</h3>

            <ul>
               <li>Be Polite</li>
               <li>Do not start games you are not in a position to finish.</li>
               <li>Don't kibitz or interfere in games that you are spectating in.</li>
               <li>Provide rules help only if asked in games you are a spectator to. And avoid starting a rules fight in a game you are not a part of.</li>
               <li>When in the Main Room, don't interrupt conversation by rolling dice. Also, don't move counters
               around on your map unless you have Auto-Report Moves turned off.</li>
               <li>When watching other people play, you can expand and contract stacks without affecting the other's
               view. Needless to say, you should not otherwise manipulate the counters.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 name="troubleshooting">G. Troubleshooting</h2>

            <p><b>PROBLEM:</b> VASL can't find my boards or overlays!</p>

            <p><b>SOLUTION:</b> Double-check the directory structure as described in the Installation section. Make sure your
            Boards directory is set correctly in the Preferences. Pay attention to upper vs. lower case. Your boards directory
            should only have the bdXX files. It should not contain any GIFs. </p>

            <p><b>PROBLEM:</b> Out of memory errors pop up when loading large scenarios. </p>

            <p><b>SOLUTION:</b> Set display to 256 colors. </p>

            <p><b>PROBLEM:</b> Still get out-of-memory errors with HASL maps. </p>

            <p><b>SOLUTION:</b> Use a paint program to split the board image into parts. Rename them and you can put them
            together as if they were geomorphic boards. If that still doesn't work, maybe you need more memory! </p>

            <p><b>PROBLEM:</b> I have a different problem! </p>

            <h2 name="contribute">H. Contribute to VASL</h2>

            <p>VASL is not the result of a single person's effort, but has grown out of the cooperation of a large number of
            people over time. There are many niches, large and small, for anybody interested in contributing. The VASL
            Cooperative is a collection of people who contribute map artwork, counter artwork, scenario setups, web support,
            and/or Java programming. Or people just interested in an inside or advance view of what's happening with VASL. </p>
